IRVING BERLIN\
"Little Butterfly"

[1st verse:]\
Butterfly, without a single care\
You flit from here to there\
Your heart is ev'rywhere\
Fluttering about from boy to boy\
Filling your heart with joy\
Playing with each new toy

[Refrain:]\
Butterfly, little butterfly\
Flitting 'round from flow'r to flower

Each time you change your mind\
You leave a lonely heart behind

You play your part with a new sweetheart\
'Til you have him in your power

And then you flutter away\
To leave him crying all day\
Come back, little butterfly


[2nd verse:]\
Butterfly, take warning while you may\
Youth only lasts a day\
Blossoms and fades away\
There will come a morning when you'll cry\
Poor little butterfly\
You know the reason why
